### Environment Variables

- **`USE_EMOJI=0`**  
  Disables emojis if your terminal cannot display them (common in Windows).  

```
USE_EMOJI=0 python -m task_manager.cli add "Test task"
```

---

## Testing

The project uses **pytest** for automated testing:

```
pytest -v
```

- Tests cover all CLI commands: add, update, delete, mark, and list tasks.  
- Temporary JSON files are used for testing so your real data is safe.  
- Emoji output is disabled in tests by setting:

```
USE_EMOJI=0 pytest -v
```
